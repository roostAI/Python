"""
To validate the business logic of the `sudoku_solver_solved` function, the following test scenarios could be considered:

1. **Complete and Correct Solution:**
   - Scenario: The input 'values' represents a fully solved and correct Sudoku grid.
   - Expected Result: The function should return `True`.

2. **Incomplete Solution:**
   - Scenario: The input 'values' represents a Sudoku grid that is not fully completed (some squares are empty or have placeholder values).
   - Expected Result: The function should return `False`.

3. **Incorrect Solution with Duplicates in a Row:**
   - Scenario: The input 'values' represents a Sudoku grid with all squares filled but with duplicate numbers in at least one row.
   - Expected Result: The function should return `False`.

4. **Incorrect Solution with Duplicates in a Column:**
   - Scenario: The input 'values' represents a Sudoku grid with all squares filled but with duplicate numbers in at least one column.
   - Expected Result: The function should return `False`.

5. **Incorrect Solution with Duplicates in a 3x3 Subgrid:**
   - Scenario: The input 'values' represents a Sudoku grid with all squares filled but with duplicate numbers in at least one 3x3 subgrid.
   - Expected Result: The function should return `False`.

6. **Correct Solution with Non-Standard Digits:**
   - Scenario: The input 'values' represents a Sudoku grid that is correctly solved but uses non-standard digits or symbols (assuming the function is meant to handle such cases).
   - Expected Result: The function should return `True` if non-standard digits are allowed, otherwise `False`.

7. **Input is `False`:**
   - Scenario: The input 'values' is the boolean `False`.
   - Expected Result: The function should return `False`.

8. **Solved but with Invalid Digits:**
   - Scenario: The input 'values' represents a Sudoku grid that is solved but contains digits outside the 1-9 range.
   - Expected Result: The function should return `False`.

9. **Correct Solution with Leading Zeros:**
   - Scenario: The input 'values' represents a Sudoku grid that is correctly solved but includes leading zeros (e.g., '01' instead of '1').
   - Expected Result: The function should return `False` if leading zeros are not allowed.

10. **Valid Puzzle with Additional or Missing Units:**
    - Scenario: The input 'values' represents a Sudoku grid that is correctly solved but has additional or missing units in the `unitlist`.
    - Expected Result: The function should return `False` since the standard Sudoku grid should have a specific number of units.

11. **Correct Solution with Mixed Data Types:**
    - Scenario: The input 'values' represents a Sudoku grid that is solved correctly but with mixed data types (e.g., integers and strings for digits).
    - Expected Result: The function should return `True` if mixed data types are functionally equivalent, otherwise `False`.

12. **Valid Puzzle with Empty Units:**
    - Scenario: The input 'values' represents a Sudoku grid that is solved correctly but one or more units in `unitlist` are empty.
    - Expected Result: The function should return `False`, as each unit should contain 9 squares.

In these scenarios, it is assumed that the `unitlist` variable and the `digits` set are predefined in the context of the function and contain the appropriate values for standard Sudoku puzzles (i.e., `unitlist` contains all rows, columns, and 3x3 subgrids, and `digits` is the set `{'1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9'}`).
