"""
To write test scenarios for the `grid_values` function that converts a Sudoku grid into a dictionary mapping, we need to consider various cases that represent the different situations the function might encounter during its execution. The provided function assumes that `squares` and `digits` are defined elsewhere in the code, and `grid` is a string of length 81 representing the Sudoku grid. Here are some test scenarios:

1. **Valid Grid with No Empties**: Test the function with a valid grid string that has all 81 characters filled with digits from 1 to 9, ensuring that no '0' or '.' are present. The function should return a dictionary with 81 key-value pairs where no value is '0' or '.'.

2. **Valid Grid with Empties Represented by Dots**: Test the function with a valid grid string that includes '.' characters to represent empty cells. The returned dictionary should accurately map these cells to '.'.

3. **Valid Grid with Empties Represented by Zeros**: Test the function with a valid grid string that includes '0' characters to represent empty cells. The returned dictionary should accurately map these cells to '0'.

4. **Grid with Invalid Characters**: Test the function with a grid string that contains characters other than digits, '0', or '.'. The function should filter out invalid characters and still return a dictionary with 81 key-value pairs.

5. **Grid with Insufficient Characters**: Test the function with a grid string that has fewer than 81 characters. The function should raise an assertion error due to the grid being too short.

6. **Grid with Excessive Characters**: Test the function with a grid string that has more than 81 characters. The function should raise an assertion error due to the grid being too long.

7. **Grid with Valid Characters but Incorrect Distribution**: Test the function with a grid string that has 81 characters but an incorrect number of digits and empty representations (e.g., too many '0' or '.' characters). The function should still return a dictionary with 81 key-value pairs, assuming the characters are within the valid set.

8. **Correctly Handling of Case Sensitivity**: If the function is intended to be case-insensitive, test with a grid string that includes lower-case 'o' instead of '0', and ensure that the function either raises an error or correctly interprets them as '0'.

9. **Grid with Mixed Empties Representation**: Test the function with a grid string that includes both '0' and '.' to represent empty cells. The function should accurately map each empty cell to its corresponding character in the returned dictionary.

10. **Grid with All Empties**: Test the function with a grid string that consists entirely of '0' or entirely of '.' characters. The returned dictionary should map all squares to the appropriate empty representation.

11. **Valid Grid with Correct Mapping**: Test the function with a valid and completely filled grid string, and manually verify that the returned dictionary correctly maps each square to its corresponding digit in the grid.

12. **Grid with Special Characters**: Test the function with a grid string that contains special characters or whitespace. The function should ignore these characters and only consider digits, '0', or '.'.

For each scenario, the expected outcome should be compared with the actual result to determine if the `grid_values` function is working as intended.
