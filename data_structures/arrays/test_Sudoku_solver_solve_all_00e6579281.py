"""
Here are some test scenarios to validate the business logic of the `solve_all` function:

1. **Single Grid Solution Test**: Provide a single solvable Sudoku grid to the function and ensure that the function returns the correct solution for the grid.

2. **Multiple Grids Solution Test**: Provide multiple solvable Sudoku grids to the function and ensure that each grid is solved correctly.

3. **Unsolvable Grid Test**: Provide an unsolvable Sudoku grid and confirm that the function returns an appropriate response indicating that the grid cannot be solved.

4. **Empty Grid Test**: Provide an empty Sudoku grid (all cells are empty) and ensure that the function is able to solve it, as an empty grid is technically solvable with any valid Sudoku solution.

5. **Performance Test**: Supply a set of grids that are known to be computationally intensive to solve and ensure that the function takes an appropriate amount of time to solve them, adhering to the `showif` parameter's intended behavior.

6. **Showif Parameter Test - Timing Display**: Provide a `showif` parameter with a specific time threshold and supply grids that take less time than the threshold as well as grids that take more time. Confirm that the display behavior is consistent with the `showif` parameter (i.e., only displaying grids that take longer than the specified time).

7. **Showif Parameter Test - None Value**: Set the `showif` parameter to `None` and ensure that no grids are displayed regardless of how long they take to solve.

8. **All Solved Puzzles Count Test**: Provide a mix of solvable and unsolvable grids and ensure that the summary correctly reflects the number of puzzles solved.

9. **Average Time Calculation Test**: Supply multiple grids and verify that the average solve time reported is correct.

10. **Maximum Time Calculation Test**: Supply multiple grids with varying solve times and ensure that the maximum time reported is the highest time taken to solve any of the grids.

11. **Frequency Calculation Test**: Supply multiple grids and verify that the frequency (puzzles per second) calculation in the summary is correct.

12. **Zero Grids Test**: Call the function with an empty list of grids and confirm that it handles this edge case gracefully, without errors, and that the summary output makes sense for zero puzzles.

13. **All Unsolvable Grids Test**: Provide only unsolvable grids and check that the summary correctly reports that no puzzles were solved.

14. **Correctness of Solved Indicator**: Ensure that the `solved(values)` function used in `time_solve` accurately reflects whether a given puzzle was solved or not.

Each of these scenarios is designed to validate different aspects of the `solve_all` function, from its ability to solve puzzles correctly to its performance and the accuracy of its reporting features.
