"""
When writing test scenarios for the `sudoku_solver_solve` function, we must consider various aspects of the Sudoku puzzle and the expected behavior of the solver. Here are several test scenarios to validate the business logic of the function:

1. **Valid Complete Puzzle**: Test with a valid, already solved Sudoku puzzle to ensure that the function recognizes the puzzle as solved and returns the correct solution.

2. **Valid Incomplete Puzzle**: Test with a valid, incomplete Sudoku puzzle to check if the function can successfully solve the puzzle.

3. **Invalid Puzzle - Contradiction**: Test with a puzzle that contains a contradiction (e.g., the same number appearing twice in a row, column, or 3x3 subgrid) to ensure the function identifies it as unsolvable.

4. **Invalid Puzzle - Empty or Incomplete**: Test with an empty grid or a grid with insufficient numbers to determine if the function can handle such scenarios gracefully without attempting to solve.

5. **Multiple Solutions**: Provide a puzzle with more than one valid solution to see if the function can find at least one solution and how it handles multiple solution scenarios.

6. **No Solution**: Test with a grid that is impossible to solve (no valid solution exists) to ensure the function correctly identifies it as unsolvable.

7. **Edge Cases**: Provide puzzles that represent edge cases, such as a grid with only one empty cell left or a grid that requires advanced solving techniques (e.g., X-Wing, Swordfish).

8. **Performance**: Test with puzzles of varying difficulty to assess the performance and efficiency of the solver. Measure the time taken to solve easy, medium, hard, and expert-level puzzles.

9. **Correctness of Solution**: For every puzzle that the solver claims to have solved, verify that the solution meets all Sudoku rules (each number 1-9 appears exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 subgrid).

10. **Idempotency**: Solve a puzzle, then run the solved puzzle through the solver again to ensure that the solution remains the same and that the solver does not make further changes.

11. **Puzzle Unchanged on Failure**: If the solver cannot solve a puzzle, ensure that it does not alter the original grid in any way.

12. **Solver Consistency**: Solve the same puzzle multiple times to determine if the solver consistently produces the same solution (if the algorithm is deterministic).

13. **Large Dataset**: Test the solver with a large dataset of puzzles to ensure that it works correctly and efficiently on a wide range of scenarios.

14. **Special Grid Layouts**: Test with puzzles that have non-standard layouts (e.g., extra regions, non-square shapes) if the solver is designed to handle such variations to ensure it can cope with unconventional puzzles.

Note that these scenarios assume the `parse_grid` function is responsible for converting the input into a format the `search` function can understand, and that the `search` function performs the actual solving logic. The test scenarios are written with these assumptions in mind.
