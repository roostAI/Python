"""
Below are test scenarios to validate the business logic of the `sudoku_solver_from_file` function, which is assumed to use the `from_file` function for input parsing:

1. **Valid File with Correct Format**:
   - Scenario: The function is provided with a valid file path containing a correctly formatted Sudoku puzzle.
   - Expected Result: The function reads the file, parses it into a list of strings where each string represents a row of the Sudoku puzzle, and solves the puzzle correctly.

2. **File with Invalid Sudoku Format**:
   - Scenario: The function is given a file with a Sudoku puzzle that is not correctly formatted (e.g., incorrect number of rows/columns, invalid characters).
   - Expected Result: The function should fail to parse the puzzle and return an appropriate error or exception indicating the format issue.

3. **Empty File**:
   - Scenario: The function is provided with an empty file.
   - Expected Result: The function should detect that the puzzle is missing and return an error or exception indicating that the input is empty.

4. **File with Extra Characters or Whitespace**:
   - Scenario: The file contains the correct Sudoku puzzle but also has extra whitespace or unrelated characters.
   - Expected Result: The function should be able to ignore or strip out irrelevant characters/whitespace and still parse and solve the Sudoku puzzle correctly.

5. **File with Incorrect Separator**:
   - Scenario: The function is given a file where the Sudoku rows are separated by a different separator than the default newline character.
   - Expected Result: The function should still correctly parse the file if the correct separator is provided as an argument to the function. If the wrong separator is used, an error should be returned.

6. **Non-Existent File**:
   - Scenario: The function is provided with a file path that does not exist.
   - Expected Result: The function should return an error or exception indicating that the file cannot be found.

7. **File with Insolvable Puzzle**:
   - Scenario: The function is given a file with a Sudoku puzzle that has no valid solution.
   - Expected Result: The function should return an error or indication that the puzzle cannot be solved.

8. **File with Multiple Valid Solutions**:
   - Scenario: The function is given a file with a Sudoku puzzle that has more than one valid solution.
   - Expected Result: The function should either provide one of the valid solutions or indicate that multiple solutions exist.

9. **Read Permissions Issue**:
   - Scenario: The function is provided with a file path that the user does not have permission to read.
   - Expected Result: The function should return an error or exception indicating a permission issue.

10. **Large File with Valid Puzzle**:
    - Scenario: The function is provided with a large file that is still a valid Sudoku puzzle.
    - Expected Result: The function should be able to handle large files without performance degradation and solve the puzzle correctly.

11. **File with Custom Separator**:
    - Scenario: The function is given a file with a custom separator that is different from the default, and the correct separator is passed as an argument.
    - Expected Result: The function should parse the file correctly using the provided separator and solve the puzzle.

12. **File with Multiple Puzzles**:
    - Scenario: The function is given a file containing several Sudoku puzzles separated by the specified separator.
    - Expected Result: The function should parse each puzzle as a separate entity and solve them individually, assuming the function is designed to handle multiple puzzles.

These scenarios cover a variety of cases that the `sudoku_solver_from_file` function might encounter when dealing with file inputs. Each scenario should be tested individually to ensure thorough coverage of the function's business logic.

# Note: For scenarios 7 to 12, you would continue to use mock.patch to simulate the file contents
# and conditions described in each scenario. You would also need to handle exceptions and
# assertions based on the expected behavior of the sudoku_solver.from_file function.
