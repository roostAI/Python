Below are test scenarios for the provided `sudoku_solver_test` function that validate the business logic without considering varying input data types as per the constraints given:

1. **Test Scenario: Validate the number of squares**
   - Description: Ensure there are exactly 81 squares in a Sudoku puzzle, as this is the standard size of the grid (9x9).

2. **Test Scenario: Validate the number of unit lists**
   - Description: Confirm that there are exactly 27 unit lists, which correspond to the 9 rows, 9 columns, and 9 boxes that each square is part of.

3. **Test Scenario: Validate units for each square**
   - Description: Check that each square belongs to exactly 3 units (1 row, 1 column, 1 box) and that the units contain the correct squares.

4. **Test Scenario: Validate peers for each square**
   - Description: Verify that each square has exactly 20 peers, which are the squares that are in the same row, column, or box but do not include the square itself.

5. **Test Scenario: Validate a specific unit's composition**
   - Description: Confirm that the units for a specific square (e.g., "C2") are correctly identified and contain the appropriate squares for the row, column, and box.

6. **Test Scenario: Validate a specific peer group's composition**
   - Description: Ensure that the peer group for a specific square (e.g., "C2") is correctly identified and contains exactly the 20 unique squares that are in the same row, column, or box as "C2", excluding "C2" itself.

7. **Test Scenario: Validate consistency across units**
   - Description: Check that all rows, columns, and boxes contain unique squares without any repetition across the entire grid.

8. **Test Scenario: Validate unit and peer integrity**
   - Description: Ensure that no square is included in its own list of peers and that the units for a square do not include the square itself.

9. **Test Scenario: Validate the symmetry of peers**
   - Description: Confirm that if square A is a peer of square B, then square B is also a peer of square A.

10. **Test Scenario: Validate the absence of duplicates in units and peers**
    - Description: Check that there are no duplicate squares in any of the units or peer sets, as this would violate Sudoku rules.

11. **Test Scenario: Validate the grid completeness**
    - Description: Confirm that the total count of squares, units, and peers equals the expected numbers when considering the entire grid.

12. **Test Scenario: Validate proper coverage of the grid**
    - Description: Ensure that each square in the grid is accounted for in the units and peers, with no omissions.

These scenarios focus on the integrity and correctness of the data structures (`squares`, `unitlist`, `units`, and `peers`) used in solving the Sudoku puzzle. The actual puzzle-solving logic would require additional test scenarios, which would involve providing a Sudoku puzzle and verifying the solution's correctness.
