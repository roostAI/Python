"""
Here are several test scenarios to validate the business logic of the `sudoku_solver_eliminate` function:

**Scenario 1: Elimination of non-existing value**
- Description: Validate that the function returns the original values without alteration if the digit to be eliminated is not present in the specified square.
- Precondition: `values[s]` does not contain `d`.
- Expected Result: The function returns `values` unchanged.

**Scenario 2: Contradiction after elimination**
- Description: Validate that the function returns `False` if a contradiction is found after eliminating the digit from a square that results in the square having no possible values.
- Precondition: `values[s]` contains `d` and no other digits.
- Expected Result: The function returns `False`.

**Scenario 3: Propagation after single value reduction**
- Description: Validate that the function eliminates the only remaining digit from the peers of the square if the square is reduced to one value.
- Precondition: `values[s]` is reduced to a single digit `d2` after elimination.
- Expected Result: The function should return `values` with `d2` eliminated from all peers of `s`.

**Scenario 4: Contradiction in peers after single value reduction**
- Description: Validate that the function returns `False` if a contradiction is found among the peers after a single value reduction.
- Precondition: Elimination of `d2` from a peer of `s` leads to a contradiction.
- Expected Result: The function returns `False`.

**Scenario 5: No place for value in unit**
- Description: Validate that the function returns `False` if, after elimination, there is no place left for the digit in a unit.
- Precondition: `d` cannot be placed in any square of a unit because it has been eliminated from all possible squares.
- Expected Result: The function returns `False`.

**Scenario 6: Single place for value in unit**
- Description: Validate that the function assigns the digit to the only remaining square in a unit where it can possibly go.
- Precondition: There is exactly one square in a unit where `d` can be placed.
- Expected Result: The function assigns `d` to that square and returns `values`.

**Scenario 7: Contradiction after assigning value to single place in unit**
- Description: Validate that the function returns `False` if a contradiction is found after assigning the digit to the only possible square in a unit.
- Precondition: Assigning `d` to the only possible square in the unit leads to a contradiction.
- Expected Result: The function returns `False`.

**Scenario 8: Multiple eliminations and propagations**
- Description: Validate that the function correctly eliminates the digit from multiple squares and properly propagates the effects throughout the Sudoku grid.
- Precondition: `values[s]` contains `d` in multiple squares, and elimination leads to further reductions and assignments.
- Expected Result: The function returns `values` with all necessary eliminations and assignments correctly made.

**Scenario 9: No elimination needed**
- Description: Validate that if the digit is not present in the square, the function does not perform any elimination and returns the original values.
- Precondition: `d` is not present in `values[s]`.
- Expected Result: The function returns the original `values` unchanged.

These scenarios cover a range of situations that the `eliminate` function may encounter when solving a Sudoku puzzle, ensuring that the elimination logic is robust and handles all cases correctly.
