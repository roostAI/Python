"""
To validate the business logic of the `display` function within the `sudoku_solver_display`, which is meant to display a Sudoku grid in a 2-D format, we can devise the following test scenarios:

1. **Correct Grid Display Scenario**: Ensure that when provided with a fully solved or partially solved Sudoku grid, the `display` function formats and prints the grid correctly, with the appropriate spacing, lines, and dividers. The output should be a 9x9 grid with values aligned in their respective cells, separated by vertical lines after every third column and horizontal lines after every third row.

2. **Empty Grid Scenario**: Test the function with an input where all the squares are empty (or represented by a placeholder such as '.'), and verify that the grid is displayed correctly with all placeholders in place, maintaining the grid structure.

3. **Invalid Grid Values Scenario**: Even though we are not checking for varying datatypes, we can check for scenarios where the grid contains invalid values (e.g., longer strings, symbols). The test should verify that the function can handle and display these values without breaking the grid structure.

4. **Incomplete Grid Structure Scenario**: Provide an input where some rows or columns are missing values (e.g., a dictionary with missing keys for certain squares). The test should check how the function handles such cases and if it still maintains the overall grid structure.

5. **Grid Consistency Scenario**: If the input grid has consistent width values across all squares, the test should confirm that the display output maintains this consistency in the grid presentation.

6. **Maximum Value Length Scenario**: Test with input where one or more squares contain the maximum length of values permissible, and verify that the grid adjusts to accommodate these values without breaking the grid structure.

7. **Line and Divider Placement Scenario**: Specifically test that the horizontal and vertical dividers are placed correctly after every third row and every third column, respectively, regardless of the content of the cells.

8. **Row and Column Alignment Scenario**: Ensure that each row aligns correctly with the others, and each column aligns correctly with the others, such that the grid appears symmetrical and properly spaced.

9. **Output Format Scenario**: Verify that the output is in the expected format (e.g., no extra spaces at the beginning or end of lines, no additional dividers, etc.).

10. **Function Robustness Scenario**: Test the function with a large number of valid inputs to ensure that it consistently displays the grid correctly under various conditions and does not exhibit any unexpected behavior.

These scenarios are designed to validate the correct behavior of the `display` function in terms of its ability to present a Sudoku grid in a readable and structured format. The actual values for the `squares`, `rows`, and `cols` variables would need to be provided to create concrete test cases based on these scenarios.
