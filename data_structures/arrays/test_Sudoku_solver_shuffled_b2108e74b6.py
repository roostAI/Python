"""
When writing test scenarios for the `sudoku_solver_shuffled` function, we would have to consider the following to validate the business logic without actually writing the test code:

1. **Shuffling Integrity**: Ensure that the output sequence is a permutation of the input sequence. Every element in the input should appear exactly once in the output, and there should be no additions or deletions.

2. **Randomness**: Verify that the function provides a good level of randomness. This could be done by calling the function multiple times with the same input and checking that a different output sequence is generated each time.

3. **Idempotence**: Check that two consecutive calls to `shuffled` with the same sequence do not always yield the same result, unless the sequence has a length of 1 or 0.

4. **Empty Sequence Handling**: Confirm that an empty input sequence returns an empty output sequence.

5. **Single-element Sequence**: Ensure that a sequence with a single element returns a sequence with that same element.

6. **Non-modification of Input**: The original input sequence should remain unmodified after the function call.

7. **Large Sequences**: Test the function with very large sequences to ensure it does not crash and still returns a valid shuffled sequence.

8. **Repeat Elements**: If the input sequence has repeated elements, ensure that the output sequence maintains the same count for each element.

9. **Stability with Identical Elements**: For a sequence with all identical elements, the output should be the same as the input, as shuffling identical elements does not change the sequence.

10. **Performance**: Evaluate the performance of the function for large inputs to ensure that it completes in a reasonable amount of time.

11. **Distribution**: For sequences with a large number of elements, test whether the shuffling is uniformly distributed over enough samples. This is to statistically validate the randomness quality.

12. **Deterministic Behavior with Seed**: If random seed is set before calling the function, verify that the shuffling is deterministic and produces the same sequence for the same seed.

Please note that in an actual test suite, you would use a testing framework and include assertions to check these scenarios. The above are simply descriptions of scenarios that would be turned into test cases.
