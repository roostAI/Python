"""
Here are several test scenarios to validate the business logic of the `parse_grid` function, which is assumed to be part of a Sudoku solver:

1. **Valid Complete Grid:**
   - **Scenario:** Pass a valid, completely filled Sudoku grid where each row, column, and 3x3 box contains all the digits 1-9 exactly once.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The function should return a dictionary mapping each square to its corresponding digit without any contradictions.

2. **Valid Incomplete Grid:**
   - **Scenario:** Pass a valid, partially filled Sudoku grid with no contradictions such that the remaining squares can potentially be filled to complete the puzzle.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The function should return a dictionary mapping each square to either a fixed digit (from the input grid) or a set of possible digits that could occupy that square.

3. **Invalid Grid with Contradictions:**
   - **Scenario:** Pass an invalid, partially filled Sudoku grid that contains contradictions, such as the same digit appearing twice in a row, column, or 3x3 box.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The function should detect the contradiction and return `False`.

4. **Empty Grid:**
   - **Scenario:** Pass an empty grid or a grid with all squares unset.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The function should return a dictionary mapping each square to all possible digits (1-9), as no assignments have been made yet.

5. **Grid with Invalid Digits:**
   - **Scenario:** Pass a grid that contains digits outside the valid Sudoku range (1-9), such as 0 or 10.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The function should ignore the invalid digits and only consider valid ones in its assignments. If the invalid digits lead to a contradiction, the function should return `False`.

6. **Grid with Single Possibility:**
   - **Scenario:** Pass a grid where at least one square has only one possible value due to the constraints imposed by the other digits in the grid.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The function should assign the single possible value to that square and propagate the constraints to reduce the possibilities for other squares accordingly.

7. **Grid with Multiple Solutions:**
   - **Scenario:** Pass a grid that is valid but has multiple solutions.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The function should still return a dictionary with possible values for each square, but it should not attempt to solve the entire grid. The test should ensure that the function does not falsely report a contradiction in such cases.

8. **Grid with No Possible Solutions:**
   - **Scenario:** Pass a grid that is valid in its current state but cannot be completed to a full solution due to the constraints of the initial setup.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The function should return `False` as at some point during the solving process, a contradiction will be detected.

9. **Grid with Non-Standard Characters:**
   - **Scenario:** Pass a grid that contains non-numeric characters in some of the squares, such as letters or symbols.
   - **Expected Outcome:** The function should ignore non-numeric characters and proceed with the numeric ones. If the non-numeric characters lead to a contradiction, the function should return `False`.

10. **Grid with Duplicate Values in a Row, Column, or Box:**
    - **Scenario:** Pass a grid where a digit is duplicated in a row, column, or 3x3 box.
    - **Expected Outcome:** The function should detect this as a contradiction and return `False`.

Each of these scenarios would need to be translated into actual test cases with corresponding input grids and expected results to validate the `parse_grid` function's correctness.
