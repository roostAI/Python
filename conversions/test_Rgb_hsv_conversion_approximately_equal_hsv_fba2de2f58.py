1. Scenario: Check when the two HSV colors are exactly the same.
    - Given: hsv_1 = [0, 0, 0], hsv_2 = [0, 0, 0]
    - Expected: The function should return True.

2. Scenario: Check when the two HSV colors are approximately the same (within the defined thresholds).
    - Given: hsv_1 = [180, 0.5, 0.3], hsv_2 = [179.9999, 0.500001, 0.30001]
    - Expected: The function should return True.

3. Scenario: Check when the two HSV colors are not approximately the same.
    - Given: hsv_1 = [0, 0, 0], hsv_2 = [1, 0, 0]
    - Expected: The function should return False.

4. Scenario: Check when only one of the HSV components (Hue, Saturation, Value) is different by more than the threshold.
    - Given: hsv_1 = [180, 0.5, 0.3], hsv_2 = [179.9999, 0.6, 0.30001]
    - Expected: The function should return False.

5. Scenario: Check when the two HSV colors are on the boundaries of the threshold.
    - Given: hsv_1 = [0, 0, 0], hsv_2 = [0.2, 0.002, 0.002]
    - Expected: The function should return True.

6. Scenario: Check when the two HSV colors are just beyond the boundaries of the threshold.
    - Given: hsv_1 = [0, 0, 0], hsv_2 = [0.201, 0.0021, 0.0021]
    - Expected: The function should return False.

7. Scenario: Check when one of the HSV components is negative (HSV values are typically positive).
    - Given: hsv_1 = [0, 0, 0], hsv_2 = [-0.1, 0, 0]
    - Expected: The function should return False.

8. Scenario: Check when the two HSV colors have the maximum HSV values.
    - Given: hsv_1 = [360, 1, 1], hsv_2 = [360, 1, 1]
    - Expected: The function should return True.
