"""
Test Scenario 1: Test with valid file and key
- Given a valid file path and a valid key, the function should return True after successfully encrypting the file. 

Test Scenario 2: Test with valid file and no key
- Given a valid file path and no key, the function should use the default key provided by the constructor and return True after successfully encrypting the file.

Test Scenario 3: Test with a non-existent file
- Given a non-existent file path and a valid key, the function should return False because the file does not exist.

Test Scenario 4: Test with a file that the user does not have permission to read
- Given a file path to a file that the user does not have permission to read and a valid key, the function should return False because it cannot read the file.

Test Scenario 5: Test with a large key
- Given a valid file path and a key larger than 256, the function should mod the key by 256 and then proceed with the encryption. The function should return True after successfully encrypting the file.

Test Scenario 6: Test with a negative key
- Given a valid file path and a negative key, the function should mod the key by 256 and then proceed with the encryption. The function should return True after successfully encrypting the file.

Test Scenario 7: Test with a file that the user does not have permission to write
- Given a file path to a file that the user does not have permission to write and a valid key, the function should return False because it cannot write the encrypted data to the file.

Test Scenario 8: Test with an empty file
- Given a file path to an empty file and a valid key, the function should create an encrypted file (which will also be empty) and return True.
