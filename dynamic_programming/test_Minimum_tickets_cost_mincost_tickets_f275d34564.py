"""
Here are a series of test scenarios to validate the business logic of the `mincost_tickets` function:

1. **Single Travel Day**: Test with only one day in the `days` list to ensure the function returns the cost of the one-day pass if it's the cheapest option.

2. **Multiple Consecutive Travel Days**: Test with multiple consecutive days in the `days` list to ensure the function calculates the cost correctly when a 7-day or 30-day pass might be cheaper than individual day passes.

3. **Multiple Non-Consecutive Travel Days**: Test with non-consecutive days in the `days` list to validate that the function correctly determines when it's more economical to buy individual day passes versus weekly or monthly passes.

4. **Boundary Values for Days**: Test with `days` containing values at the boundary, such as 1 and 365, to ensure the function handles edge cases correctly.

5. **Sparse Travel Days Throughout the Year**: Test with a sparse distribution of travel days throughout the year to check if the function correctly calculates the minimum cost over long periods without travel.

6. **Costs with Large Differences**: Test with `costs` where there is a substantial difference between the cost of daily, weekly, and monthly passes to ensure that the function chooses the most economical long-term option.

7. **Ascending Costs**: Test with `costs` in ascending order (e.g., [2, 7, 15]) to ensure the function doesn't default to the longer-duration pass if it's not economical.

8. **Descending Costs**: Test with `costs` in descending order (e.g., [15, 7, 2]) to validate that the function handles cases where longer-duration passes are cheaper.

9. **All Passes Have the Same Cost**: Test with `costs` where all three passes cost the same to ensure the function chooses the pass with the longest duration.

10. **No Travel Days**: Test with an empty `days` list to validate that the function returns 0.

11. **All Types of Passes Used**: Test with a `days` list that would require the use of all three types of passes (daily, weekly, and monthly) to ensure the function combines them correctly for the minimum cost.

12. **Costs with Zero Value**: Test with `costs` containing zero to ensure the function does not consider free passes as an option.

13. **Non-Integer Values in Costs**: Test with non-integer values in `costs` to ensure the function raises a `ValueError`.

14. **Days List with Duplicates**: Test with `days` containing duplicate values to ensure the function correctly ignores duplicate days and does not double-count them.

15. **Days List Not in Chronological Order**: Test with `days` not sorted in chronological order to ensure the function sorts the days and calculates the cost correctly regardless of the order of input.

16. **Overlap of Weekly and Monthly Passes**: Test with a `days` list that has dense travel periods where both weekly and monthly passes might be economical to ensure the function calculates the overlap correctly.

17. **Leap Year Consideration**: Test with `days` including February 29 to ensure the function handles leap years correctly.

18. **Days Out of Range**: Test with `days` containing values less than 1 or greater than 365 to ensure the function raises a `ValueError`.

19. **Costs List with Less or More Than Three Elements**: Test with `costs` containing fewer or more than three elements to ensure the function raises a `ValueError`.

20. **Maximum Travel Days**: Test with `days` containing all possible travel days from 1 to 365 to ensure the function can handle the maximum input size.
