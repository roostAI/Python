"""
To validate the business logic of the `fizz_buzz` function without writing any test code, we can define several test scenarios. Here are the scenarios:

1. **Basic Functionality Test**
   - Scenario: Test a range of iterations where numbers are not multiples of 3 or 5.
   - Expected Result: The returned string should contain the numbers themselves separated by spaces.

2. **Multiple of Three Test**
   - Scenario: Test a range of iterations where some numbers are multiples of 3 but not 5.
   - Expected Result: The returned string should replace multiples of 3 with "Fizz".

3. **Multiple of Five Test**
   - Scenario: Test a range of iterations where some numbers are multiples of 5 but not 3.
   - Expected Result: The returned string should replace multiples of 5 with "Buzz".

4. **Multiple of Three and Five Test**
   - Scenario: Test a range of iterations where some numbers are multiples of both 3 and 5.
   - Expected Result: The returned string should replace multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz".

5. **Mixed Multiples Test**
   - Scenario: Test a range of iterations that includes multiples of 3, multiples of 5, and multiples of both.
   - Expected Result: The returned string should correctly replace each number with "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz" appropriately.

6. **Single Iteration Test**
   - Scenario: Test where the number of iterations is exactly 1.
   - Expected Result: The returned string should contain either the number, "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz" based on its divisibility.

7. **Negative Number Test**
   - Scenario: Test where the starting number is negative.
   - Expected Result: The function should raise a `ValueError` stating that the starting number must be an integer greater than 0.

8. **Zero Iterations Test**
   - Scenario: Test where the number of iterations is 0.
   - Expected Result: The function should raise a `ValueError` stating that iterations must be done more than 0 times to play FizzBuzz.

9. **Negative Iterations Test**
   - Scenario: Test where the number of iterations is negative.
   - Expected Result: The function should raise a `ValueError` stating that iterations must be done more than 0 times to play FizzBuzz.

10. **Large Number Test**
    - Scenario: Test a very large number of iterations to check for performance issues or potential overflow problems.
    - Expected Result: The function should return the correct string without performance degradation or runtime errors.

11. **Boundary Conditions Test**
    - Scenario: Test the function at the boundaries where numbers switch from non-multiples to multiples of 3, 5, or both (e.g., from 2 to 3, or from 14 to 15).
    - Expected Result: The function should correctly identify the transition from printing numbers to printing "Fizz", "Buzz", or "FizzBuzz".

Remember that these scenarios assume the provided function signature and expected behavior are correct. Actual test code would need to be written to execute these scenarios and validate that the function behaves as expected.
