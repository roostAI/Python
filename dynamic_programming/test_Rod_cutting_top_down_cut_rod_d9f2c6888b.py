"""
To validate the business logic of the `top_down_cut_rod` function, consider the following test scenarios:

1. **Optimal Substructure Property**: Verify that the function correctly decomposes the problem into smaller problems and combines their solutions to solve the larger problem. For example, the maximum revenue for a rod of length 4 should be the best combination of cutting/not cutting for lengths 1, 2, and 3.

2. **Memoization Effectiveness**: Ensure that the memoization mechanism is working by checking if previously computed values are reused. This can be done by tracing the function or by checking the number of recursive calls.

3. **Zero-Length Rod**: Test the function with a rod of length 0 to confirm that the maximum revenue is 0, as there is nothing to sell.

4. **Single-Length Rod**: Test the function with a rod of length 1 to ensure that the maximum revenue is equal to the price of a single-length rod.

5. **All Equal Prices**: Test the function with a rod where all prices are the same, regardless of the length. The result should be the price multiplied by the length of the rod.

6. **Descending Prices**: Test the function with a rod where prices are in descending order. The function should return the price of the full-length rod as the maximum revenue.

7. **Ascending Prices**: Test the function with a rod where prices are in ascending order. The function should find the optimal cut that maximizes revenue.

8. **Random Price Sequence**: Test the function with a rod where prices are randomly distributed. This scenario is to ensure the function works with arbitrary price distributions.

9. **Large Value of n**: Test the function with a large value of n to verify that the memoization handles large input sizes without a stack overflow and within reasonable time constraints.

10. **Price List Length Mismatch**: Test the function with a price list whose length is different from the rod length n (either shorter or longer) to ensure that the `_enforce_args` function is validating inputs correctly.

11. **Negative Prices**: Test the function with negative prices to ensure that the function can handle such cases if the business logic allows for losses or discounts.

12. **Single Optimal Cut**: Test the function with a rod length and price list where the optimal solution is to make only one cut. This tests the function's ability to identify the best single cut.

13. **Multiple Optimal Cuts**: Test the function with a rod length and price list where the optimal solution involves multiple cuts. This tests the function's ability to identify the best combination of multiple cuts.

14. **Non-integer Prices**: While the scenario excludes varying input data types, ensuring that the function can handle prices as floating-point numbers is important if the business logic allows for it.

15. **Boundary Conditions**: Test the function at the boundaries of rod lengths and prices, such as extremely high or low values, to check for any overflow or underflow issues.

16. **Repeating Price Patterns**: Test the function with a repeating pattern of prices to ensure that the function can identify the pattern and make optimal cuts accordingly.

Remember that each test scenario should verify both the correct revenue is returned and that the cuts proposed (if the function also returns the cuts) are indeed the optimal solution for maximizing revenue.
