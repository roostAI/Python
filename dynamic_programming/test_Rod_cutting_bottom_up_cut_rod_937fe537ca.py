"""
Given the `bottom_up_cut_rod` function, we can outline several test scenarios to validate the business logic:

1. **Zero-Length Rod**: Test the function with `n = 0` to ensure it returns 0, as there's no rod to cut and hence no revenue.

2. **Single-Length Rod**: Test the function with `n = 1` and a price list of one element to ensure it returns the price of a single-length rod.

3. **Perfect Match**: Test the function with `n` equal to the length of `prices` list to ensure the function does not try to access prices beyond the array bounds and returns the correct maximum revenue.

4. **Maximum Revenue**: Test the function with known inputs and outputs where cutting the rod increases the revenue (e.g., `n = 4`, `prices = [1, 5, 8, 9]` should return 10).

5. **No Cuts Better**: Test with a scenario where the best option is not to cut the rod at all (e.g., `n = 2`, `prices = [1, 5]` should return 5).

6. **All Cuts Worse**: Test with a scenario where making any cut would result in worse revenue than keeping the rod intact (e.g., `n = 2`, `prices = [5, 4]` should return 5).

7. **Complex Cuts**: Test the function with a more complex scenario where multiple cuts yield the highest revenue (e.g., `n = 8`, `prices = [1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20]`).

8. **Large Input**: Test the function with a large value of `n` and a correspondingly large `prices` list to evaluate the performance and ensure it still returns the correct maximum revenue.

9. **Repeated Values**: Test the function with repeated values in the `prices` list to ensure the algorithm correctly handles these cases (e.g., `n = 10`, `prices = [1, 5, 8, 9, 10, 17, 17, 20, 24, 30]`).

10. **Increasing Prices**: Test the scenario where the prices increase with the length of the rod (e.g., `n = 5`, `prices = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`) to ensure the function captures the incremental value.

11. **Decreasing Prices**: Test with decreasing prices (e.g., `n = 5`, `prices = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`) to ensure the algorithm does not make unnecessary cuts.

12. **Varying Prices**: Test with `prices` that vary in a non-monotonic manner (e.g., `n = 5`, `prices = [3, 5, 2, 8, 6]`) to ensure the function finds the optimal solution amidst fluctuations.

13. **Boundary Conditions**: Test with `n` being 1 less or 1 more than the length of `prices` to check for any off-by-one errors.

14. **Full Rod Price Not Given**: Test with `n > len(prices)` to ensure the function can handle the case where the price of the full rod is not explicitly given.

15. **Exception Handling**: Verify that the function raises appropriate exceptions or errors when `prices` is empty or when `n` is negative, as these are invalid inputs.

Note that the `_enforce_args` function mentioned in the code is assumed to perform argument validation, so scenarios related to input validation are not included.
