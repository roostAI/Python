Here are some test scenarios to validate the business logic of the `_enforce_args` function:

1. **Test Scenario: Valid Arguments**
   - Description: Pass a non-negative integer `n` and a price list with at least `n` items.
   - Expected Result: The function should not raise any exceptions.

2. **Test Scenario: Negative Length of Rod**
   - Description: Pass a negative integer `n` and any price list.
   - Expected Result: The function should raise a `ValueError` with a message indicating that `n` must be non-negative.

3. **Test Scenario: Prices List Shorter Than Rod Length**
   - Description: Pass a positive integer `n` and a price list with fewer than `n` items.
   - Expected Result: The function should raise a `ValueError` with a message indicating that each integral piece of the rod must have a corresponding price.

4. **Test Scenario: Zero Length Rod with Empty Prices List**
   - Description: Pass `n` as 0 and an empty price list.
   - Expected Result: The function should not raise any exceptions, as a rod of length 0 does not require any prices.

5. **Test Scenario: Zero Length Rod with Non-Empty Prices List**
   - Description: Pass `n` as 0 and a non-empty price list.
   - Expected Result: The function should not raise any exceptions, as a rod of length 0 does not require prices but having extra prices should not cause an issue.

6. **Test Scenario: Prices List Exactly Matches Rod Length**
   - Description: Pass a positive integer `n` and a price list with exactly `n` items.
   - Expected Result: The function should not raise any exceptions, as the condition of having at least as many prices as the rod length is satisfied.

7. **Test Scenario: Prices List Longer Than Rod Length**
   - Description: Pass a positive integer `n` and a price list with more than `n` items.
   - Expected Result: The function should not raise any exceptions, since having extra prices is not prohibited by the function's logic.

8. **Test Scenario: Edge Case with Maximum Integer Value for Length**
   - Description: Pass `n` as `sys.maxsize` (the maximum size of an integer) and a price list with `sys.maxsize` items.
   - Expected Result: The function should not raise any exceptions, assuming the system can handle a list of that size.

9. **Test Scenario: Rod Length as Zero but Prices List Has Negative Prices**
   - Description: Pass `n` as 0 and a price list with negative values.
   - Expected Result: The function should not raise any exceptions related to the length of the rod or the size of the price list, since it only enforces argument lengths, not the values within the prices list.

10. **Test Scenario: Rod Length and Prices List Both With Large Values**
    - Description: Pass a large positive integer `n` and a price list with a large number of items, testing the function's ability to handle large inputs.
    - Expected Result: The function should not raise any exceptions if the price list has at least `n` items.

These scenarios are designed to cover the different edge cases and typical usage patterns of the `_enforce_args` function to ensure that the function behaves as expected under various conditions.
