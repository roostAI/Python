"""
To validate the business logic of the `rod_cutting_main` function, we need to create test scenarios that cover various aspects of the rod-cutting problem. Here are some test scenarios to consider:

1. **Basic Functionality Test**: Verify that the function calculates the correct maximum revenue for a given array of prices and length of the rod. This is the standard case and should match the expected output.

2. **Empty Price List**: Test the function with an empty price list to ensure it handles this edge case correctly, likely returning a revenue of 0.

3. **Single Length Rod**: Test with a price list that contains only one price (the rod cannot be cut). The function should return the price of the single piece.

4. **Descending Price List**: Test with a price list where prices are in descending order, which might not be optimal for cutting. The function should still return the maximum revenue possible.

5. **Ascending Price List**: Test with a price list where prices are in ascending order. This scenario should confirm that the function is finding the optimal cuts.

6. **All Equal Prices**: Test with a price list where all prices are the same. The optimal solution should be to cut the rod into pieces of length 1, assuming the price per unit length is constant.

7. **Zero Prices**: Test with a price list where all prices are zero. The function should return a revenue of 0 regardless of the rod length.

8. **Negative Prices**: Test with negative prices to see if the function can handle this scenario, which might represent a cost rather than a profit.

9. **Large Input**: Test with a very large rod length and corresponding price list to ensure the function can handle large inputs and doesn't run into performance issues or stack overflow in recursive implementations.

10. **Non-Optimal Subdivision Prices**: Test with a price list where non-trivial subdivisions (not cutting into pieces of length 1) result in higher revenue, to ensure the function is truly finding the optimal solution.

11. **Repeated Values in the Price List**: Test with a price list that contains repeated values to ensure the function can handle this and still find the optimal cut.

12. **Rod Length Longer Than Price List**: Test with a rod length that is longer than the number of prices provided. The function should assume that there are no additional profits to be made beyond the last specified length.

13. **Rod Length Shorter Than Price List**: Test with a rod length that is shorter than the number of prices provided. The function should only consider the prices up to the length of the rod.

14. **Real-World Scenario**: Use a real-world example with actual prices and lengths that a business might provide to ensure the function is practical and gives expected results.

15. **Comparing Methods**: Verify that the top-down, bottom-up, and naive recursive methods all return the same maximum revenue for various test cases, as implied by the assertions in the main function.

Remember, this list of scenarios is designed to think through various edge cases and typical uses of the function to ensure it behaves correctly under a wide range of conditions. When writing actual test code, each of these scenarios would translate into a test case with specific input data and expected results.
