"""
To validate the business logic of the `_top_down_cut_rod_recursive` function, consider the following test scenarios:

1. **Base Case**: Test the function with a rod of length `0`. The maximum revenue should be `0` as there is no rod to sell.

2. **Single Length Rod**: Test the function with a rod of length `1` and a price list where the price for a unit length is greater than `0`. The maximum revenue should be equal to the price of a single unit length.

3. **Optimal Substructure**: Test the function with a rod of varying lengths (e.g., `2`, `3`, `4`, etc.) and a price list to ensure that the function correctly utilizes previously computed maximum revenues for smaller sub-rods.

4. **Overlapping Subproblems**: Test the function with a larger rod length to verify that it reuses the memoized solutions for smaller subproblems, improving performance over simple recursion.

5. **Max Revenue Calculation**: Test the function with a rod of a specific length and a price list that has non-trivial optimal solutions (i.e., cutting the rod in certain ways leads to higher revenue than selling it as a whole). Verify that the function returns the correct maximum revenue.

6. **Full Rod Length Price**: Test the function with a rod of a specific length where the maximum revenue is achieved by not cutting the rod at all. Ensure that the function can identify that selling the rod as a whole is the best option.

7. **Complex Price List**: Test the function with a rod of a specific length and a complex price list where the price does not necessarily increase with the length of the rod. The test should confirm that the function finds the correct combination of cuts.

8. **Memoization Efficiency**: Test the function with a large rod length and verify that the `max_rev` list has been populated with computed revenues for all lengths up to `n`. This checks that memoization is working and that the function is efficient.

9. **Negative Prices**: Test the function with a price list that contains negative values. The function should handle this gracefully, ensuring that negative prices do not lead to a maximum revenue calculation.

10. **All Zero Prices**: Test the function with a price list where all prices are zero. The maximum revenue should also be `0`, regardless of the rod length.

11. **Non-integer Revenue**: While the function assumes integer prices, test it with a price list containing floating-point numbers to ensure that it can handle non-integer prices and still return the correct maximum revenue.

12. **Incorrectly Initialized `max_rev`**: Feed the function with a `max_rev` list that has incorrect precomputed values (e.g., all set to `0` or random values for a rod length greater than `0`). The function should correct these values and return the accurate maximum revenue.

13. **Boundary Conditions**: Test the function with the maximum rod length that can fit into the prices list to ensure that the function handles boundary conditions correctly.

14. **Performance Test**: Run the function with a very long rod length and a corresponding price list to assess the performance and ensure that the memoization effectively reduces the time complexity from exponential to polynomial.

15. **Multiple Calls Consistency**: Call the function multiple times with the same rod length and price list to ensure that the memoized results are consistent across calls.
