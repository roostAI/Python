"""
Here are test scenarios to validate the business logic of the `minimum_tickets_cost_dynamic_programming` function, assuming the function takes an input list of days where the user is traveling, and a list of costs for 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day tickets, respectively:

1. **Empty Days Set**
   - Scenario: The user is not traveling on any day.
   - Expected Result: The function should return 0 as no tickets are needed.

2. **Single Day of Travel**
   - Scenario: The user travels only on one day within the year.
   - Expected Result: The function should return the cost of the 1-day ticket.

3. **Multiple Days of Travel within a Week**
   - Scenario: The user travels on multiple days but all within a 7-day period.
   - Expected Result: The function should return the minimum cost between a 7-day ticket and the sum of individual 1-day tickets.

4. **Multiple Days of Travel over Several Weeks**
   - Scenario: The user travels on multiple days spread over several weeks.
   - Expected Result: The function should return the minimum cost considering the combination of 1-day, 7-day, and 30-day tickets.

5. **Travel Every Day**
   - Scenario: The user travels every day of the year.
   - Expected Result: The function should return the minimum cost, which might be multiple 30-day tickets or a combination of 30-day and 7-day tickets.

6. **Travel Once Every Week**
   - Scenario: The user travels one day every week for the entire year.
   - Expected Result: The function should return the minimum cost, likely several 7-day tickets.

7. **Travel with Large Gaps**
   - Scenario: The user has long gaps (more than 30 days) between travel days.
   - Expected Result: The function should return the sum of 1-day tickets for each travel day.

8. **Travel Days at Year Boundary**
   - Scenario: The user travels at the end of one year and the beginning of the next year.
   - Expected Result: The function should properly handle the year boundary and calculate the minimum cost for tickets.

9. **Costs Are Zero**
   - Scenario: The cost of all tickets (1-day, 7-day, 30-day) is zero.
   - Expected Result: The function should return 0 regardless of the travel days.

10. **One Ticket Type Is Always Optimal**
    - Scenario: The cost of one type of ticket is so low that it is always the best option regardless of the travel pattern.
    - Expected Result: The function should return the cost of that ticket type multiplied by the necessary quantity.

11. **Non-Sequential Travel Days**
    - Scenario: The user travels on non-sequential days, such as day 1, day 15, and day 50.
    - Expected Result: The function should calculate the minimum cost considering the most cost-effective combination of tickets.

12. **Travel Days Spanning Multiple Months**
    - Scenario: The user travels on days spread across multiple months.
    - Expected Result: The function should return the minimum cost considering the use of 30-day tickets or a combination of 7-day and 1-day tickets, whichever is cheaper.

13. **All Days Are Travel Days Except One**
    - Scenario: The user travels every day except for one day in the year.
    - Expected Result: The function should return a cost close to the maximum possible cost minus the cost of a 1-day ticket.

14. **High Cost for Short Term Tickets**
    - Scenario: The cost of 1-day and 7-day tickets is disproportionately high compared to the 30-day ticket.
    - Expected Result: The function should favor 30-day tickets in most scenarios.

15. **Invalid Days (Out of Range)**
    - Scenario: The input list of days contains days that are out of the valid range (e.g., day 366 or day 0).
    - Expected Result: The function should either ignore the invalid days or handle them appropriately if the business logic requires it.

Remember that these scenarios assume the existence of a `days_set` and `costs` variables that are used within the function, and they would have to be set up appropriately for each test case when generating the actual test code.
